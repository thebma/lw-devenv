### About Lightweight
Lightweight is a collection of FiveM resources (or plugins) aimed at offering a rich feature set without touching the internals.
We aim at being a minimal, yet powerful layer between the RAGE engine and developers, delivering powerful interfaces which perform well in numerous use cases.
